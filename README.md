# Project Waves

## :milky_way: 1. Origin Story 

It is often difficult to co-ordinate and arrange meetings, especially for a large group where people have different timetables.

Even though we have tools like When2Meet that facilitates this process, it is still not a streamlined experience.

And as a wise man once said:
> "Idk bro, When2Meet is kinda shit" - Aristotle (probably)

Which is how this project was born, where we seek to make a webapp that streamlines and provide a better experience when it comes to arranging meetings.
